####  RegEx Exercise 1: Find the Time  ####

The time has a format: hours:minutes. Both hours and minutes have two digits, like 09:00.
Make a regexp to find time in the string: Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456. In this task there’s no need to check time correctness yet, so 25:99 can also be a valid result. The regexp should not match 123:456.
