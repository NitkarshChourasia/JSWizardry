####  Is the Number a Prime? (with a twist)  ####

Write a function that takes a number and returns true if it's a prime; false otherwise. The number can be 2^64-1 (2 to the power of 63, not XOR). With the standard technique it would be O(2^64-1), which is much too large for the 10 second time limit imposed by Edabit.



[Examples]

___
prime(7) ➞ true

prime(56963) ➞ true

prime(5151512515524) ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

A "prime" number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 (upon division the result is a whole number).
