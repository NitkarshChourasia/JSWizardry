####  Find the Odd Integer  ####

Create a function that takes an array and finds the integer which appears an odd number of times.


[Examples]

___
findOdd([1, 1, 2, -2, 5, 2, 4, 4, -1, -2, 5]) ➞ -1

findOdd([20, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 4, 20, 4, 5]) ➞ 5

findOdd([10]) ➞ 10
_____



[Notes]

There will always only be one integer that appears an odd number of times.
