####  Solving Linear Equations (Part 1)  ####

Consider the equation ax+1=b+x where a and b are constants.
Create a function that takes numbers a and b as arguments, and returns the solution of the equation. If the equation does not have a solution, return "No solution". If any number satisfies the equation, return "Any number".


[Examples]

___
solve(4, 7) ➞ 2.0

solve(9, 5) ➞ 0.5

solve(12, -4) ➞ -0.455
_____



[Notes]

Round your answer to three decimal places.
