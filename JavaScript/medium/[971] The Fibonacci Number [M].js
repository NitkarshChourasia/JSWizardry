####  The Fibonacci Number  ####

Create a function that, given a number, returns the corresponding value of that index in the Fibonacci series.
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
___
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
_____

The next number is found by adding the two numbers before it:
___
*) The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1).
*) The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2).
*) The 5 is (2+3), and so on!
___



[Examples]

___
fibonacci(3) ➞ 3

fibonacci(7) ➞ 21

fibonacci(12) ➞ 233
_____



[Notes]

The first number in the sequence starts at 1 (not 0).
