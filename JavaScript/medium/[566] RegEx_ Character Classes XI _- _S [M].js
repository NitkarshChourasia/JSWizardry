####  RegEx: Character Classes XI ‚Å†- \S  ####

You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.
Here are a list of the characters classes in JavaScript:
___
., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]
_____

Write a regex that will return true if the bio does not have any spaces before the last ending punctuation ?. You must use the \S character class in your expression.
___
"Can read a spray chart and a balance sheet. 1 part Executive, 1 part entrepreneur, 2 parts geek and 3 parts baseball coach. Too many parts?"
_____

The bio above is in the correct format. Therefore your RegEx should return true for it.
