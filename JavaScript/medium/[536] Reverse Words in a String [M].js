####  Reverse Words in a String  ####

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word, the first word will be the last, and so on.


[Examples]

___
reverseWords(" the sky is blue") ➞ "blue is sky the"

reverseWords("hello   world!  ") ➞ "world! hello"

reverseWords("a good example") ➞ "example good a"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
*) The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*) You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
*) Try to solve this in linear time.
