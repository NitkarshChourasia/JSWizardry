####  Swap the Numbers  ####

Imagine you have three numbers: a, b, and c. c is equal to either a or b, but you don't know which one. Your task is to create a function that returns whatever number c isn't, out of a and b. So, if c is equal to a, return b, and if c is equal to b, return a. Here's what makes this challenge difficult: you cannot use any if statements.


[Examples]

___
swap(1, 0, 0) ➞ 1
// a = 1, b = 0, c = b
// return a

swap(1, 3, 1) ➞ 3
// a = 1, b = 3, c = a
// return b

swap(27, 31, 31) ➞ 27
// a = 27, b = 31, c = b
// return a

[Notes]

___
*) To prevent cheating, you also can't call any functions.
*) c will always be equal to either a or b.
*) a will never equal b.
*) a, b, and c will always be integers.
