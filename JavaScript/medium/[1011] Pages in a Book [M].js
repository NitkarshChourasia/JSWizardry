####  Pages in a Book  ####

Suppose that you add all of the page numbers in a book. If the total is 21, the book could only have 6 pages because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. If I had said the total were 25, that would be impossible because the next number in the series is 28 (21 + 7).
Create a function that, given the total number of pages as an argument, returns true if it is a valid total and false if it is not.
Can you devise a solution that is more efficient than simply adding consecutive integers as I did above?

pagesInBook(5) ➞ false

pagesInBook(4005) ➞ true

pagesInBook(9453) ➞ true
