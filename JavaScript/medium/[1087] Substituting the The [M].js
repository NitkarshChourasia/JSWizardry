####  Substituting the The  ####

Create a function that replaces "the" in the sentence with "an" or "a". Remember that if the next word begins with a vowel, use "an". In the case of a consonant, use "a".


[Examples]

___
replaceThe("the dog and the envelope") ➞ "a dog and an envelope"

replaceThe("the boy ran at the wall") ➞ "a boy ran at a wall"

replaceThe("the egg, the spoon and the espionage") ➞ "an egg, a spoon and an espionage"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Sentences will always be in lowercase.
*) The last word of the sentence will never be "the".
*) This won't cover edge cases such as "an hour" or "a unique thing" (since they sound differently to the rule).
