####  ES6: Destructuring Objects IV  ####

___
const obj =  { first: "James", last: "Baker", alias: "JB"  }

var { first = "John", last = "Doe", alias } = obj

console.log(nickname) // outputs nickname is not defined
_____

There may be times where we would like the property name to be different from the object property names we receive and also give those new property names a default value.


[Question]

Use ES6 object destructuring to rename the variable alias to nickname and give nickname a default value of "JD". Ignore the .toString() function (used for validation).


[Notes]

___
*) Use double quotes for "JD".
*) If you know how to use object destructuring, go ahead and complete this challenge, otherwise check the Resources tab for some examples.
