####  Design Patterns I: JavaScript Classes?!?  ####

JavaScript doesn't really have classes like other languages. They are actually functions behind the scenes. There are several ways to create classes.


[Challenge]

___
*) Create a Book class using a JavaScript function - instantiable.
*) It should have an author and published property.
*) Create an Author class using a literal object - singleton.
*) It should have a name and books property.
*) Create a Publisher class by using the new constructor and an anonymous function - singleton.
*) It should have an authors and books property.
*) Create a Review class using a class declaration - instantiable.
*) It should have a rating and user property.
___



[Bonus (optional)]

Create a Bookstore class using an IIFE - singleton. It should have a books and prices property.


[Notes]

___
*) All classes should begin with Capital letters.
*) All class properties should have default(initial) values.
*) There are a few other ways to make classes but are not in this challenge, you can check the Resources tab to learn more.
