####  Preventing the Collapse of the Universe  ####

Dividing by 0 is a huge mistake and should be avoided at all costs.
Create a function that when given a math expression as a string, return True if at any point, the expression involves dividing by 0.


[Examples]

___
catchZeroDivision("2 / 0") ➞ true

catchZeroDivision("4 / (2 + 3 - 5)") ➞ true

catchZeroDivision("2 * 5 - 10") ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

Multiplication signs will be given as an asterisk *.
