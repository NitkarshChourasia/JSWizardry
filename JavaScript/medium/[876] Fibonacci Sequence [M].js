####  Fibonacci Sequence  ####

The Fibonacci Sequence is the sequence of numbers (Fibonacci Numbers) whose sum is the two preceding numbers (e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc). Using 0 and 1 as the starting values, create a function that returns an array containing all of the Fibonacci numbers less than 255.


[Examples]

On generating a Fibonacci number where input is the two preceding values starting from 0 and 1 [0, 1, ...].
