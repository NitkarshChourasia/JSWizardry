####  Count the Points in a Circle  ####

Count the total number of coordinates on a two-dimensional grid that are inside a given circle. The function has four parameters: the points (provided as a list of objects), the circle's center x coordinate, the circle's center y coordinate, and the circle's radius. For example:


[Examples]

___
pointsInCircle([
  { x: 0, y: 0 },
  { x: 1, y: 1 },
  { x: 0, y: 5 },
  { x: 10, y: 10 }
], 0, 0, 5) ➞ 2
_____



[Notes]

Only count the coordinates that are in the circle, not the ones that are on the border.
