####  Is This a Right Angled Triangle?  ####

Given three numbers, x, y and z, determine whether they are the edges of a right angled triangle.


[Examples]

___
rightTriangle(3, 4, 5) ➞ true
// This is the classic example of a "nice" right angled triangle.

rightTriangle(145, 105, 100) ➞ true
// This is a less famous example.

rightTriangle(70, 130, 110) ➞ false
// This isn't a right angled triangle.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Notice the largest side of the triangle might not be the last one passed to the function.
*) All numbers will be integers (whole numbers).
