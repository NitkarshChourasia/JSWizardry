/*
####  Product of All Other Numbers  ####

You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.


[Examples]

___
getProducts([1, 7, 3, 4]) ➞ [84, 12, 28, 21]

getProducts([1, 2, 6, 5, 9]) ➞ [540, 270, 90, 108, 60]

getProducts([1, 2, 3, 0, 5]) ➞ [0, 0, 0, 30, 0]
_____



[Notes]

You can't use division, otherwise you might end up dividing by 0 and the universe would end.
