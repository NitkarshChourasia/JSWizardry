####  "EdaBit" Challenge  ####

Create a function that returns the array of numbers from a given range. But for multiples of three, return “Eda” instead of the number and for the multiples of five, return “Bit”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, return “EdaBit”.


[Examples]

___
edaBit(0, 10) ➞ ["EdaBit", 1, 2, "Eda", 4, "Bit", "Eda", 7, 8, "Eda", "Bit" ]

edaBit(14, 20) ➞ [14,  "EdaBit", 16, 17,  "Eda", 19, "Bit" ]

edaBit(99, 106) ➞ ["Eda", "Bit", 101, "Eda", 103, 104, "EdaBit", 106 ]
_____



[Notes]

In case the number 0 happens to be in the range, return "EdaBit" as well.
