####  RNA Reverse Complement  ####

Create a function that finds the reverse complement of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The RNA will be represented as a string containing only the characters "A", "C", "G" and "U". Since RNA can only (canonically) allow pairings of A/U and G/C, the complement of an RNA would be as follows:

Your function should find the complement on the right AND also reverse the resulting string.


[Examples]

___
reverseComplement("GUGU") ➞ "ACAC"

reverseComplement("UCUCG") ➞ "CGAGA"

reverseComplement("CAGGU") ➞ "ACCUG"
_____



[Notes]

You can assume all input seqeuences will be valid.
