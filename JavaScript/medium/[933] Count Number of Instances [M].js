####  Count Number of Instances  ####

Create a class named User and create a way to check the number of users (number of instances) that were created, so that the value can be accessed as a class attribute.


[Examples]

___
u1 = new User("johnsmith10")
User.userCount ➞ 1

u2 = new User("marysue1989")
User.userCount ➞ 2

u3 = new User("milan_rodrick")
User.userCount ➞ 3
_____

Make sure that the usernames are accessible via the instance attribute username.
___
u1.username ➞ "johnsmith10"

u2.username ➞ "marysue1989"

u3.username ➞ "milan_rodrick"
_____
