####  Book Shelf  ####

Create a Book constructor that has two properties :

and two methods:

and instantiate this constructor by creating 3 new books:

The name of the new object instances PP, H, and WP, respectively.
For instance, if I instantiated the following book using this Book constructor function:
___
*) Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling (HP)
___

I would get the following properties and methods:


[Examples]

___
HP.title ➞ "Harry Potter"
HP.author ➞ "J.K. Rowling"
HP.getTitle() ➞ "Title: Harry Potter"
HP.getAuthor() ➞ "Author: J.K. Rowling"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Read more about constructor functions in Resources.
*) Remember, after you've finished writing the constructor function, you must instantiate it through the creation of new objects.
