####  Merge Arrays in Order  ####

Given two arrays, merge them to one array and sort the new array in the same order as the first array.


[Examples]

___
mergeSort([1, 2, 3], [5, 4, 6]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

mergeSort([8, 6, 4, 2], [-2, -6, 0, -4]) ➞ [8, 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6]

mergeSort([120, 180, 200], [190, 175, 130]) ➞ [120, 130, 175, 180, 190, 200]
