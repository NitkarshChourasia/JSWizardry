####  One, Two, Skip a Few  ####

Create a function which calculates how many numbers are missing from an ordered number line. This number line starts at the first value of the array, and increases by 1 to the end of the number line, ending at the last value of the array.
___
howManyMissing([1, 2, 3, 8, 9]) ➞ 4

// The number line starts at 1 and ends at 9 (so the numbers 0 and 10 aren't missing from it).
// The numbers missing from this line are 4, 5, 6, and 7.
// 4 numbers are missing.
_____



[Examples]

howManyMissing([5, 6, 7, 8]) ➞ 0
