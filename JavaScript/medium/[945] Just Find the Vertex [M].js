####  Just Find the Vertex  ####

Today Juan learned to graph quadratic equations, so he chose to speed up the process and avoid having to write a lot of steps in his notebook to find the vertex. Just help him locate the vertex.
Ok, I am going to give you some advantages. The first is that you will not have to perform so many steps. The equations will have an easy structure to avoid much complexity.
Here I will leave you a shorter explanation of how we can find the vertex.
We have the following equation:
___
-5x ^ 2 + 50x -120
_____

Now we apply the formula to locate the vertex:
___
-b / (2 * a)
_____

We divide our second term by 2 multiplied by the first term. Remember to use the negative sign in b. It would look like this:
___
-50 / (2 * -5) = 5
_____

... The third term will be insufficient in the challenge, but I wanted to add it to see if it complicates you.
... Remember to return the result rounded to zero decimals.


[Examples]

___
findVertex("-5x + 50x -120") ➞ 5

findVertex("-6x + 36x -72") ➞ 3

findVertex("7x +14x +28") ➞ -1
_____



[Notes]

List comprehension and unpacking is useful in this challenge :)
