####  RegEx: Boundary Assertions III  ####

Write a regular expression that ensures the word "end" is inside of another word (e.g. "bending"). Non-word characters such as !, ?, etc. cannot be boundaries.


[Examples]

___
"The end of the story." ➞ false
"Endings are pointless." ➞ false
"Let's send!" ➞ false
"We viewed the rendering at the end." ➞ false
"Sometimes bending the rules is good." ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You cannot use \w, *, . or + in your expressions.
*) You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
*) The expression should be case-insensitive and should check all occurences of "end".
*) Find more info on RegEx and boundary assertions in Resources.
