####  Bug: Regular Expression  ####

Indira first year computer science student is taking an intro to RegEx class. Her professor gives her the assignment to write a function that checks whether an input date as a string is in the format yyyy/mm/dd. She has written a regular expression but the regular expression does not seem to be correct. Help her fix the error.

assignment("12/1/1") ➞ false

assignment("1234/12/01") ➞ true

assignment("2012/1/1") ➞ false

assignment("2012/01/07") ➞ true
