####  RegEx XXII : Unicode property escapes  ####

Unicode property escapes match characters based on their Unicode properties - Binary ("boolean-like") or non-binary. They can be used to match emojis, punctuations, letters (even letters from specific languages or scripts), etc.
___
const sentence = "A ticket to Â§ßÈò™ costs ¬•2000 üëå."

sentence.match(/\p{Emoji_Presentation}/gu) ‚ûû ["üëå"]
_____

Note: For Unicode property escapes to work, a regular expression must use the u flag which indicates a string must be considered as a series of Unicode code points. See also RegExp.prototype.unicode.
Note: Some Unicode properties encompasses much more characters than some character classes (such as \w which matches only latin letters, a to z) but the latter is better supported among browsers (as of January 2020).
Match all words in the nonEnglishText using a unicode property escape.
___
const nonEnglishText = "–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ê–ª–∏—Å—ã –≤ –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ —á—É–¥–µ—Å"

const regex = /\w+/gu
nonEnglishText.match(regex) ‚ûû null, \w doesn't work with non english text

const regexpBMPWord = /([\u0000-\u0019\u0021-\uFFFF])+/gu
nonEnglishText.match(regexpBMPWord) ‚ûû [ '–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è', '–ê–ª–∏—Å—ã', '–≤', '–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ', '—á—É–¥–µ—Å' ], this works

const regexpUPE = /YOUR SOLUTION HERE/gu
nonEnglishText.match(regexpUPE) ‚ûû [ '–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è', '–ê–ª–∏—Å—ã', '–≤', '–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ', '—á—É–¥–µ—Å' ], an easier way
