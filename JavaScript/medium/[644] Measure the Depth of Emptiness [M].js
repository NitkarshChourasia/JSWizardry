####  Measure the Depth of Emptiness  ####

In this challenge you will receive an input of the form:
___
[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]
_____

In other words, an array containing an array containing an array containing... an array containing nothing.
Your goal is to measure the depth of this array, where [] has a depth 1, [[]] has depth of 2, [[[]]] has depth 3, etc.


[Examples]

___
measureDepth([]) ➞ 1

measureDepth([[]]) ➞ 2

measureDepth([[[]]]) ➞ 3

measureDepth([[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]) ➞ 11
_____
