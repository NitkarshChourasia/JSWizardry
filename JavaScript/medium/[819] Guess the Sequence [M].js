####  Guess the Sequence  ####

Mubashir is trying to figure out the corresponding quadratic formula for the following quadratic sequence of numbers:

If you can figure this out, then help him by creating a function that takes a number n and returns the nth number of this quadratic sequence.


[Examples]

___
guessSequence(1) ➞ 90

guessSequence(2) ➞ 240

guessSequence(3) ➞ 450
_____



[Notes]
