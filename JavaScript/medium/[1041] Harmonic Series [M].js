####  Harmonic Series  ####

In mathematics, the harmonic series is the divergent infinite series:

Its name derives from the concept of overtones, or harmonics in music.
Create a function that, given a precision parameter n, returns the value of the partial sum of the harmonic series up to n terms.


[Examples]

___
harmonic(3) ➞ 1.833

harmonic(1) ➞ 1.0

harmonic(5) ➞ 2.283
_____



[Notes]

Round the result to the third decimal place.
