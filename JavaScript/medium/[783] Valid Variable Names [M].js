####  Valid Variable Names  ####

When creating variables, the variable name must always start with a letter and cannot contain spaces, though numbers and underscores are allowed to be contained in it also.
Create a function which returns true if a given variable name is valid, otherwise return false.


[Examples]

___
variableValid("result") ➞ true

variableValid("odd_nums") ➞ true

variableValid("2TimesN") ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Inputs are given as strings.
*) Variable names with spaces are not allowed.
*) Although this question may seem like otherwise, you can't actually assign words with quotes around them as variables.
*) The rules exposed in this challenge are an oversimplification on how variable and identifier names are considered valid in JavaScript.
