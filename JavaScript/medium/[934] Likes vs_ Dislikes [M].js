####  Likes vs. Dislikes  ####

YouTube currently displays a like and a dislike button, allowing you to express your opinions about particular content. It's set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time.
There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface:

Create a function that takes an array of button inputs and returns the final state.


[Examples]

___
likeOrDislike(["Dislike"]) ➞ "Dislike"

likeOrDislike(["Like", "Like"]) ➞ "Nothing"

likeOrDislike(["Dislike", "Like"]) ➞ "Like"

likeOrDislike(["Like", "Dislike", "Dislike"]) ➞ "Nothing"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) If no button is currently active, return "Nothing".
*) If the array is empty, return "Nothing".
___
