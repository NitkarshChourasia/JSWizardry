####  camelCase ⇄ snake_case  ####

Create two functions toCamelCase() and toSnakeCase() that each take a single string and convert it into either camelCase or snake_case. If you're not sure what these terms mean, check the Resources tab above.


[Examples]

___
toCamelCase("hello_edabit") ➞ "helloEdabit"

toSnakeCase("helloEdabit") ➞ "hello_edabit"

toCamelCase("is_modal_open") ➞ "isModalOpen"

toSnakeCase("getColor") ➞ "get_color"
_____



[Notes]

Test input will always be appropriately formatted as either camelCase or snake_case, depending on the function being called.
