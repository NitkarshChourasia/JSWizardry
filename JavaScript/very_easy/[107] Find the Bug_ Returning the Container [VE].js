####  Find the Bug: Returning the Container  ####

The packaging system is running wild! The candy is lying loose all over in the warehouse, the cereal is missing, and bread is stuffed in a bottle. What is going on here? The candy should be in plastic and the bread should be in a bag.
The packaging machine is running the getContainer() function to retrieve the container of a product. But something is not right...


[Examples]

___
getContainer("Bread") ➞ "bag"

getContainer("Beer") ➞ "bottle"

getContainer("Candy") ➞ "plastic"

getContainer("Cheese") ➞ null
_____



[Notes]

Think about what the object's packaging should be.
