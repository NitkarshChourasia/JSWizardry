####  Minimal II: Boolean Redundancy  ####

Check the principles of minimalist code in the intro to the first challenge.
In the Code tab you will find a code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section down below.
Write a function that returns the string "even" if the given integer is even, and the string "odd" if it's odd.


[Tips]

Converting a boolean, or something that will ultimately be interpreted as a boolean, into a boolean is redundant.
For example, the code:
___
let bool = Boolean(x < 4)
return bool === true
_____

Is equivalent to simply:
___
return x < 4
_____

___
*) A comparison with <, <=, ===, !==, >=, > will always result in a boolean, therefore using the function Boolean() is totally unnecessary.
*) bool === true is redundant, as it will always return bool.
*) To obtain the opposite of bool we could use bool === false. However, a much cleaner way of doing this is simply !bool.
*) While preserving readability, avoid declaring unnecessary variables.

Can anyone point me to some code to determine if a number in JavaScript is even or odd?

//Your code should go here:

numParity = (num) => num % 2 ? "odd" : "even";

if (require.main == module) {
    // Test cases.

    console.log(numParity(3)); // odd.
    console.log(numParity(146)); // even.
    console.log(numParity(19)); // odd.
    console.log(numParity(0)); // even.
