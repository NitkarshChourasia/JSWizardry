//Your code should go here:

"use strict";

function squared(input_number){
    return Math.pow(input_number, 2)
    // return input_number ** 2
}
// so numbers with decimals can also have squares?
// What kind of numbers can have squares? What kind of numbers cannot have squares?

if (require.main == module){
    console.log(squared(5))
    console.log(squared(9))
    console.log(squared(100))
}

// complete.
