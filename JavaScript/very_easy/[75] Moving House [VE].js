####  Moving House  ####

I'd like to calculate how long on average I've lived in a single house.
Given a person's age and the number of times they've moved house as moves, return the average number of years that they've spent living in the same house.


[Examples]

___
yearsInOneHouse(30, 1) ➞ 15

yearsInOneHouse(15, 2) ➞ 5

yearsInOneHouse(80, 0) ➞ 80
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You can assume that the tests include people who've always lived in a house.
*) Round to the nearest year.
