####  ES6: Destructuring Objects II  ####

___
const obj =  { one : 1, two : 2 }

var { one, two } = obj
_____

We can assign variables by the same name properties of objects, but what if I wanted to assign obj.one to a different name like anotherOne?
Use ES6 object destructuring to assign obj.one to the variable anotherOne. Variable two needs to remain assigned to obj.two. Ignore the .toString() function (used for validation).
