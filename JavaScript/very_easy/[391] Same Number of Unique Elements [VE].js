####  Same Number of Unique Elements  ####

Write a function that returns true if two arrays have the same number of unique elements, and false otherwise.
To illustrate:
___
arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4]
arr2 = [2, 5, 7]
_____

In arr1, the number 4 appears three times, which means it contains three unique elements: [1, 3, 4]. Since arr1 and arr2 both contain the same number of unique elements, this example would return true.


[Examples]

___
same([1, 3, 4, 4, 4], [2, 5, 7]) ‚ûû true

same([9, 8, 7, 6], [4, 4, 3, 1]) ‚ûû false

same([2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ‚ûû true
_____
