####  Radian to Degree  ####

Create a function that takes an angle in radians and converts it into degrees.


[Examples]

___
toDegree(Math.PI) ➞ 180

toDegree(Math.PI/2) ➞ 90

toDegree(Math.PI/4) ➞ 45
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The input angles are in radians.
*) Check out the Resources tab.
*) There are 360 degrees and 2 pi radians in a circle. So to convert degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2 * pi (approx. 6.28). Or equivalently, divide by 180 and multiply by pi.
