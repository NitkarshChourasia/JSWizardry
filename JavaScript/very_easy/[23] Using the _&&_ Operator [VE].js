####  Using the "&&" Operator  ####

JavaScript has a logical operator &&. The && operator takes two boolean values, and returns true if both values are true.
Consider a && b:
___
*) a is checked if it is true or false.
*) If a is false, false is returned.
*) b is checked if it is true or false.
*) If b is false, false is returned.
*) Otherwise, true is returned (as both a and b are therefore true ).
___

The && operator will only return true for true && true.
Make a function using the && operator.


[Examples]

___
and(true, false) ➞ false

and(true, true) ➞ true

and(false, true) ➞ false

and(false, false) ➞ false
