//Your code should go here:

// Don't we have to import anything?
// How we import things?
function cubes(a) {
    return Math.pow(a, 3);
}


if (require.main == console) {
    console.log(cubes(3))
    console.log(cubes(5))
    console.log(cubes(10))
}

// Most of the time make your code only your documentation.
