####  Format I: Template String  ####

Write a template string according to the following example:


[Example]

___
const a = "John";
const b = "Joe";
const c = "Jack";
const template = "your template string" ➞ "Their names were:  John,  Joe  and  Jack."
_____



[Tips]

A template string is a string that uses a Dollar sign and curly braces inside backticks ${} as a placeholder that can then be formatted:
___
const name = John;
`hello, my name is ${name}.` ➞ "hello, my name is John."
_____

You can put an expression inside the curly braces :
___
const age = 12;
`Hello, you are ${age < 18 ? 'young' : 'old'}.` ➞ "Hello, you are young."
