####  Sum of Polygon Angles  ####

Given an n-sided regular polygon n, return the total sum of internal angles (in degrees).


[Examples]

___
sumPolygon(3) ➞ 180

sumPolygon(4) ➞ 360

sumPolygon(6) ➞ 720
_____



[Notes]

___
*) n will always be greater than 2.
*) The formula (n - 2) x 180 gives the sum of all the measures of the angles of an n-sided polygon.
