####  On/Off Switches  ####

Create a function that returns how many possible arrangements can come from a certain number of switches (on / off). In other words, for a given number of switches, how many different patterns of on and off can we have?


[Examples]

___
posCom(1) ➞ 2

posCom(3) ➞ 8

posCom(10) ➞ 1024
_____



[Notes]

All numbers will be whole and positive.

//Your code should go here:

function posCom(n) {
    return Math.pow(2, n);
}

if (require.main == module){
    console.log(posCom(1));
    console.log(posCom(3));
    console.log(posCom(10));
