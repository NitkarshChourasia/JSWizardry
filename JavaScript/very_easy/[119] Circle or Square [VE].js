####  Circle or Square  ####

Given the radius of a circle and the area of a square, return true if the circumference of the circle is greater than the square's perimeter and false if the square's perimeter is greater than the circumference of the circle.


[Examples]

___
circle_or_square(16, 625) âžž True

circle_or_square(5, 100) âžž False

circle_or_square(8, 144) âžž True
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You can use Pi to 2 decimal places (3.14).
*) Circumference of a circle equals 2 * Pi * radius.
*) To find the perimeter of a square using its area, find the square root of area (to get side length) and multiply that by 4.
