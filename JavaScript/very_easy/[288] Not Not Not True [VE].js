// Not not false

// Not not not not not not true

[Notes]

Even though this challenge can be easily solved through the use of an if | else block, you might want to solve it through the use of a Boolean Logic Operator or a Bitwise Operator, taking the opportunity to become acquainted with these methods (check the Resources tab to find specific links).
