####  Buggy Uppercase Counting  ####

In the Code tab is a function which is meant to return how many uppercase letters there are in a list of various words. Fix the list comprehension so that the code functions normally!


[Examples]

___
countUppercase(["SOLO", "hello", "Tea", "wHat"]) ➞ 6

countUppercase(["little", "lower", "down"]) ➞ 0

counUppercase(["EDAbit", "Educate", "Coding"]) ➞ 5

[Notes]

___
*) Check the Resources for some array methods that might be helpful.
*) This is originally a loose translation of a Python problem. However, the Pythonic List Comprehension syntax was never really adopted in JavaScript, so I elected to make our Uppercase counter broken in a few other ways.
*) A lot of people (including me!) have rewritten the function entirely. I'm gonna make an executive decision and say that's fine here (even though complete rewrites are generally not a good idea!).
