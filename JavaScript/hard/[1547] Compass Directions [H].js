####  Compass Directions  ####

You face 1 out of the 4 compass directions: N, S, E or W.
___
*) A left turn is a counter-clockwise turn. e.g. N (left-turn) ➞ W.
*) A right turn is a clockwise turn. e.g. N (right-turn) ➞ E.
___

Create a function that takes in a starting direction and a sequence of left and right turns, and outputs the final direction faced.


[Examples]

___
finalDirection("N", ["L", "L", "L"]) ➞ "E"

finalDirection("N", ["R", "R", "R", "L"]) ➞ "S"

finalDirection("N", ["R", "R", "R", "R"]) ➞ "N"

finalDirection("N", ["R", "L"]) ➞ "N"
_____



[Notes]

You can only face 1 out of the 4 compass directions: N, S, E or W.
