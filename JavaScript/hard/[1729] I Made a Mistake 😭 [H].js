####  I Made a Mistake ðŸ˜­  ####

I made a mistake and overwrote a JSON file with some weird data, thankfully I had no back-up and I'm too lazy to fix it so now you guys can solve it for me!
Get the strings out of those arrays.


[Examples]

___
getValue([[[[[[[[[[[[[[[["Bazinga"]]]]]]]]][]]]]]]]]) âžž "Bazinga"

getValue([[[][[[[[[[["God, what is happening"]]]]]]]]]) âžž"God, what is happening"

getValue([[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]) âžž "What... why did you make this?"

getValue([[][][][][][][][[][][[[[[[["I have no idea what i'm doing"]]]]]]]]]) âžž 
"I have no idea what i'm doing"

[Notes]

Notice that if there is no string, you should return a pre-defined string (see example #3).
