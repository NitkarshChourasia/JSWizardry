####  25% Discount on the Most Expensive Item  ####

You want to introduce a discount for your online store. Every customer gets a 25% discount on the most expensive item in the shopping cart. The discount will be calculated on just one item, even if the customer buys more than one of the most expensive item.
Create a function that takes an object and returns the total price after discount.
