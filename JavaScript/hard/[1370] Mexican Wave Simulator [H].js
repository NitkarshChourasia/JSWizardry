####  Mexican Wave Simulator  ####


The wave (known as a Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms.
Create a function that takes a string and turns it into a Mexican Wave.


[Examples]

___
wave("edabit") ➞ ["Edabit", "eDabit", "edAbit", "edaBit", "edabIt", "edabiT"]

wave("just do it") ➞ ["Just do it", "jUst do it", "juSt do it", "jusT do it", "just Do it", "just dO it", "just do It", "just do iT"]

wave(" ") ➞ []
_____
