####  Tall People  ####

Create a function that takes a 2D array as an argument and returns the number of people whose view is blocked by a tall person. The concert stage is pointed towards the top of the 2D array and the tall person (represented by a 2) blocks the view of all the people (represented by a 1) behind them.


[Examples]

___
block([
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]) ➞ 2

// The tall person blocks 2 people behind him thus
// the function returns 2.


block([
  [1, 2, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
]) ➞ 5

// There are 2 tall people that block everyone behind
// them. The first tall person in the first row blocks 3
// people behind him while the second tall person in
// the second row blocks 2 people behind him thus the
// function returns 5.


block([
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [2, 1, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
]) ➞ 4
