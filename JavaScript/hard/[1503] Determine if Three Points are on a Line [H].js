####  Determine if Three Points are on a Line  ####

Create a function that returns true if three points belong to the same line, and false otherwise. Each point is represented by an array consisting of an x- and y-coordinate.


[Examples]

___
sameLine([[0, 0], [1, 1], [3, 3]]) ➞ true

sameLine([[-2, -1], [2, 1], [0, 0]]) ➞ true

sameLine([[-2, 0], [-10, 0], [-8, 0]]) ➞ true

sameLine([[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]]) ➞ false

sameLine([[3, 4], [3, 5], [6, 6]]) ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

Note the special case of a vertical line.
