####  Learn Lodash: _.pull, Pull Items From an Array  ####

According to the lodash documentation, _.pull Removes all given values from array using SameValueZero for equality comparisons. Note that unlike _.without, this method mutates array.

[Example]

You work in a car dealership. A government inspector is coming to visit and wants to ensure you are only selling electric cars. Your boss asks you to pull all the cars that aren't electric off the lot.
___
pull("electric", "gas", "electric", "gas", "gas", "electric", "gas")
âžž ["electric", "electric", "electric"]
