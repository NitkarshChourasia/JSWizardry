####  Is the Input Factorial of an Integer?  ####

Create a function to check if a given integer is a factorial of integer or not. The return value should be a boolean.


[Examples]

___
isFactorial(2) ➞ true
// 2 = 2 * 1 = 2!

isFactorial(27) ➞ false

isFactorial(24) ➞ true
// 24 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4!

[Notes]

___
*) Input is a positive integer.
*) Alternatively, you can solve this with a recursive approach.
