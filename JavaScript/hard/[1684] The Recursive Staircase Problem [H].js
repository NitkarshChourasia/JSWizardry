####  The Recursive Staircase Problem  ####

In the Recursive Staircase Problem, your task is to find the number of ways of climbing a staircase of n stairs, with a set s possible steps. The example below shows that if n was 2 and s was [ 1, 2 ], the answer would be 2:
___
       _
   _ |2  You could either go from step 0-2 (because the set s contains 2), or
_ | 1    you could go from 0-1-2 (because the set s contains 1, taking one step at a time).
0

[Examples]

___
numWays(4, [1, 2]) ➞ 5

numWays(3, [1, 2, 3]) ➞ 4

numWays(10, [1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ 401
_____



[Notes]

The more efficient your solution the better. Do not use unecessary recursion as this will mean the program needs far longer to complete the tests.
