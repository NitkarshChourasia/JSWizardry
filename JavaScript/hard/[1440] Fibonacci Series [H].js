####  Fibonacci Series  ####

Given a positive integer n, compute the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence. For those of you that have been living under a rock in the mathematical world, here's the definition:
___
*) The first and second terms are 1.
*) nth term is the (n-1)th term + the (n-2)th term. So the 3rd term is the 1st term + the 2nd term, the 4th term is the 3rd term + the 2nd term, etc.
___

Thus the sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...


[Examples]

___
fibo(1) ➞ 1

fibo(2) ➞ 1

fibo(3) ➞ 2

fibo(6) ➞ 8

fibo(30) ➞ 832040
_____
