####  Cuban Prime  ####

Create a function to check whether a given number is Cuban Prime. A cuban prime is a prime number that is a solution to one of two different specific equations involving third powers of x and y. For this challenge we are only concerned with the cuban numbers from the first equation. We ignore the cuban numbers from the second equation.


[Equation Form]

___
p = (x^3 - y^3)/(x - y), x  = y + 1, y > 0
_____

... and the first few cuban primes from this equation are 7, 19, 37, 61, 127, 271.


[Examples]

___
cubanPrime(7) ➞ "7 is cuban prime"

cubanPrime(9) ➞ "9 is not cuban prime"

cubanPrime(331) ➞ "331 is cuban prime"

cubanPrime(40) ➞ "40 is not cuban prime"
_____
