####  Fibonacci Recursion  ####

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic use case for recursive functions since the value of the sequence at a given index is dependent on the last two values. More precisely, it's dependent on the sum of the previous two values.
Write a function named fib that takes an integer n as its input. It should return the Fibonacci sequence's value at index n.


[Examples]

___
fib(6) ➞ 8
// 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

fib(1) ➞ 1

fib(2) ➞ 1
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Assume n will always be a non-negative integer.
*) Assume the Fibonacci sequence's first two values (at indices 0 and 1) are 0 and 1.
*) You must make fib a recursive function.
___



[Tips]

___
*) You can call a function within itself to get the value a different iteration returns. This is called a "recursive function".
*) If you're getting stuck, try looking up the math behind the Fibonacci sequence to see if that inspires you.
*) Check the Resources tab for relevant information!
