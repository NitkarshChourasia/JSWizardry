This challenge concerns strings such as:
___
"repeatedrepeatedrepeated"
_____

... that are obtained by repeating a smaller string, which in this case is the string "repeated".
On a related note, since the string above is made of 3 repetitions, one way to produce this string is via the code "repeated".repeat(3).
Write a function that, given a string, either:
___
*) Returns false if the string isn't made by repeating a smaller string or ...
*) Returns the number of repetitions if the string repeats a smaller string.
___



[Examples]

___
isRepeated("repeatedrepeatedrepeated") âžž 3

isRepeated("overintellectualizations") âžž False

isRepeated("nononononononononononono") âžž 12

isRepeated("moremoremoremoremoremore") âžž 6

isRepeated(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,") âžž 24
_____



[Notes]

To keep things a little simpler, all strings in the tests will have length exactly 24, just as in all the examples above. In particular, the answers will always be divisors of 24.
