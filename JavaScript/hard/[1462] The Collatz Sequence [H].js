####  The Collatz Sequence  ####

The Collatz sequence is as follows:
___
*) Start with some given integer n.
*) If it is even, the next number will be n divided by 2.
*) If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to make the next number.
*) The sequence stops when it reaches 1.
___

According to the Collatz conjecture, it will always reach 1. If that's true, you can construct a finite sequence following the aforementioned method for any given integer.
Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the highest integer in the corresponding Collatz sequence.


[Examples]

___
maxCollatz(10) ➞ 16
// Collatz sequence: 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

maxCollatz(32) ➞ 32
// Collatz sequence: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

maxCollatz(85) ➞ 256
// Collatz sequence: 85, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
