####  The Hangman Game  ####

Create a function that, given a phrase and number of letters guessed, returns a string with hyphens - for every letter of the phrase not guessed, and each letter guessed in place.


[Examples]

___
hangman("helicopter", ["o", "e", "s"]) ➞ "-e---o--e-"

hangman("tree", ["r", "t", "e"]) ➞ "tree"

hangman("Python rules", ["a", "n", "p", "r", "z"]) ➞ "P----n r----"

hangman("He"s a very naughty boy!", ["e", "a", "y"]) ➞ "-e"- a -e-y -a----y --y!"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The letters are always given in lowercase, but they should be returned in the same case as in the original phrase (see example #3).
*) All characters other than letters should always be returned (see example #4).
