/*
####  Promises VIII: Old Callback API  ####

You may run into some old asynchronous API that requires you to pass in a callback. Take the setTimeout() function for example:
___
setTimeout(() => saySomething("1 second passed"), 1000)
_____

What if an error occured in the saySomething() function. How could you handle it? Wrap it with a Promise!
There are some elements missing in the wait function, it should return a promise. Create an error handler and assign the error to ERR inside the handler.


[Notes]

___
*) Do not change the function saySomething().
*) You should not have to erase any of the existing code.
*) Check Resources if you get stuck.
