####  Recursion: Inclusive Array Ranges  ####

Write a function that, given the start startNum and end endNum values, return an array containing all the numbers inclusive to that range. See examples below.


[Examples]

___
inclusiveArray(1, 5) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

inclusiveArray(2, 8) ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

inclusiveArray(10, 20) ➞ [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

inclusiveArray(17, 5) ➞ [17]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order.
*) If startNum is greater than endNum, return an array with the higher value. See example #4.
*) You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
*) An iterative version of this challenge can be found via this link.
*) A collection of challenges in recursion can be found via this link.
