####  Recursion: Halve and Halve Again  ####

Given two integers a and b, return how many times a can be halved while still being greater than b.


[Examples]

___
halveCount(4666, 544) ➞ 3
// (4666 -> 2333 -> 1166.5 -> 583.25)

halveCount(466, 54) ➞ 3
// (466 -> 233 -> 116.5 -> 58.25)

halveCount(1324, 98) ➞ 3
// (1324 -> 662 -> 331 -> 165.5)

halveCount(624, 8) ➞ 6
// (624 -> 312 -> 156 -> 78 -> 39 -> 19.5 -> 9.75)

halveCount(1000, 3) ➞ 8
// (1000 -> 500 -> 250 -> 125 -> 62.5 -> 31.25 -> 15.625 -> 7.8125 -> 3.90625)

[Notes]

___
*) Integer a will always be (at least) greater than the twice of b.
*) You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
