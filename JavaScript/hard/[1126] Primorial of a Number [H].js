####  Primorial of a Number  ####

In mathematics, primorial, denoted by “#”, is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, the function only multiplies prime numbers.
Create a function that takes an integer n and returns its primorial.


[Examples]

___
primorial(1) ➞ 2
// First prime number = 2

primorial(2) ➞ 6
// Product of first two prime numbers = 2*3 = 6

primorial(6) ➞ 30030
_____



[Notes]

n >= 1.
