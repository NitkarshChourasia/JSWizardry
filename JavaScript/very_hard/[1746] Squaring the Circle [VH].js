####  Squaring the Circle  ####

This challenge is more about geometry and trig than code-writing, but some may find it interesting.
A circle has a circumference of 100 meters. A regular polygon, let's say a square, inscribed inside this circle has a perimeter of about 90 meters. As you increase the number of sides of the regular polygon, it's perimeter will become arbitrarily close to 100 meters.
Write a function whose argument is the number of sides of the inscribed regular polygon. The function returns the polygon's perimeter. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.


[Examples]

___
circle(3) ➞ 82.699

circle(12) ➞ 98.862

circle(100) ➞ 99.984

circle(1000) ➞ 100.0
// Perimeter is actually <100, rounding makes it 100.
