####  Fraction to Mixed Number  ####

Create a function that takes a string representing a fraction, and return a string representing that input as a mixed number.
___
*) Mixed numbers are of the form 1 2/3 — note the space between the whole number portion and the fraction portion.
*) Resulting fractions should be fully reduced (see example #2).
*) If a result is a whole number with no fractional remainder, return only the whole number portion (see example #3).
*) If a result is only fractional with no whole number, return only the fractional portion (see example #4).
*) If a result is negative, the whole number should carry the negative sign. If the result would not have a whole number portion, the numerator of the fractional portion should carry the negative sign (see examples #5 - #7).
