####  Palindrome Timestamps  ####

Create a function that takes two times of day (hours, minutes, seconds) and returns the number of occurences of palindrome timestamps within that range, inclusive.
A palindrome timestamp should be read the same hours : minutes : seconds as seconds : minutes : hours, keeping in mind the seconds and hours digits will reverse. For example, 02 : 11 : 20 is a palindrome timestamp.


[Examples]

___
palendromeTimestamps(2, 12, 22, 4, 35, 10) ➞ 14

palendromeTimestamps(12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13) ➞ 6

palendromeTimestamps(6, 33, 15, 9, 55, 10) ➞ 0

[Notes]

___
*) Expect military time.
*) Include the given time parameters if they happen to be palendromes.
*) The parameter timestamps are chronological.
