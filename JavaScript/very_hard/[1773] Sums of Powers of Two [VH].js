####  Sums of Powers of Two  ####

Every number can be expressed as the sum between unique powers of two. For example, the number 21 can be expressed as 1 + 4 + 16, which can also be written as 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4.
Create a function that returns a sorted list of powers of two, which add together to make n.


[Examples]
