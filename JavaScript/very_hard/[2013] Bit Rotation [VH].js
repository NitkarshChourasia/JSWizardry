####  Bit Rotation  ####

JavaScript offers some bit operations but not bit rotation. To complete that, create a function that takes three parameters:

Your function should return an integer as a result of its rotated binary representation.


[Examples]

___
bitRotate(8, 1, true) ➞ 4
// 8 in bin: 1000, rotated 1 step to the right: 0100, in dec: 4

bitRotate(16, 1, false) ➞ 1
// 16 in bin: 10000, rotated 1 step to the left: 00001, in dec: 1

bitRotate(17, 2, false) ➞ 6
// 17 in bin: 10001, rotated 2 steps to the left: 00110, in dec: 6
_____



[Notes]

For parameters use unsigned integers only.
