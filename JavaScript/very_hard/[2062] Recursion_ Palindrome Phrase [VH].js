####  Recursion: Palindrome Phrase  ####

A palindrome is a series of letters or numbers that reads equivocally backwards. Write a recursive function that determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not.


[Examples]

___
isPalindrome("Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog!") ➞ true

isPalindrome("This phrase, surely, is not a palindrome!") ➞ false

isPalindrome("Eva, can I see bees in a cave?") ➞ true
