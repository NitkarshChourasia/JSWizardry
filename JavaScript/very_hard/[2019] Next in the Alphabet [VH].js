/*
####  Next in the Alphabet  ####

Create a function which returns the next letters alphabetically in a given string. If the last letter is a "Z", change the rest of the letters accordingly.


[Examples]

___
nextLetters("A") ➞ "B"

nextLetters("ABC") ➞ "ABD"

nextLetters("Z") ➞ "AA"

nextLetters("CAZ") ➞ "CBA"

nextLetters("") ➞ "A"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Tests will all be in CAPITALS.
*) Empty inputs should return a capital "A" (as if it were in letter position 0!).
*) Think about the letter "Z" like the number 9 and how it carries over to increment the next letter/digit over.
