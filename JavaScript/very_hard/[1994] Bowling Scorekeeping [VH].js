####  Bowling Scorekeeping  ####

Tenpin bowling scores can range from 0 (all gutter balls) to 300 (a perfect game). If you are unfamiliar with scorekeeping, please see the Resources tab for a quick description.
A complete record of a 10 frame bowling game can be given as an array of the number of pins knocked down by each ball in sequence from the beginning to the end of the game.
Create a function whose argument is such an array. The function should return the final score.
