####  A Knapsack  ####

Given a knapsack with a certain weight capacity, fill it with loot from a list of items to achieve the highest value possible.
The function takes two parameters: an int specifying the maximum weight the knapsack can hold, and an array of item Objects to choose from. Each item has a name, a weight, and a value. The total weight of all chosen items cannot exceed the capacity of the knapsack.
The function should return an object containing the capacity of the bag, a list of items that were added to the bag (in the same order that they were given), the total weight of those items, and the total value of the items.


[Example]

knapsack(0, items) ➞ {

  items: [],
  weight: 0,
  value: 0
