####  Phrase or Word Inverse  ####

Create a function that inverts words or the phrase depending on the value of parameter type. A "P" means to invert the entire phrase, while a "W" means to invert every word in the phrase. See the following examples for clarity.


[Examples]

___
inverter("This is Valhalla", "P") ➞ "Valhalla is this"

inverter("One fine day to start", "W") ➞ "Eno enif yad ot trats"

inverter("Division by powers of two", "P") ➞ "Two of powers by division"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The first character of the returned string should be in uppercase and the rest are in lowercase.
*) There will be no empty strings as inputs. Punctuation marks, though quite important for grammatical correctness, are discounted in the input phrases.
