####  Triplet Sum  ####

Create a function that takes an unsorted list of numbers and returns the number of unique triplets whose sum is equal to the variable n.


[Examples]

___
tripletSum([1, 0, 2, 6, 3, 9, 3], n = 11) ➞ 2
// Since we found two unique triplets that equate to 11: 0+2+9 and 2+6+3

tripletSum([1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11], n = 20) ➞ 5

tripletSum([5, 2, 8], n = 2) ➞ 0
