/*
####  Prime Factorization  ####

Create a function that returns the prime factorization of a number as a sorted list of arrays. Include the multiplicity of each prime in the arrays:
___
*) [(prime_0, mult_0), ..., (prime_k, mult_k)]
*) where prime_0 < prime_1 < ... < prime_k
___



[Examples]

___
getPrimeFactorization(4) ➞ [[2, 2]]

getPrimeFactorization(10) ➞ [[2, 1], [5, 1]]

getPrimeFactorization(60) ➞ [[2, 2], [3, 1], [5, 1]]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Don't worry about negatives or floats. All inputs will be positive numbers.
*) 1 is not a prime! Do not include it. You will not be given 1 as an input.
*) All inputs will be less than 10,000.
