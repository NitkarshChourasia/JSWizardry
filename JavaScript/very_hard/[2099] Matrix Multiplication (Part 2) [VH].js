####  Matrix Multiplication (Part 2)  ####

Create a function that multiplies two matrices (n x m) and (p x q) and returns:
___
*) "invalid" if the matrices are not multiplicable (i.e. if m is not equal to p).
*) The multiplication matrix (n x q) otherwise.
___



[Examples]

___
matrixMultiply([[1, 2]], [[3], [4]]) ➞ [[11]]

matrixMultiply([[0, 0], [0, 1]], [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) ➞ "invalid"

matrixMultiply([[4, 2], [3, 1]], [[5, 6], [3, 8]]) ➞ [[26, 40], [18, 26]]
_____



[Notes]

This challenge is a generalized version of Matrix Multiplication.

But to multiply a matrix by another matrix we need to do the "dot product" of rows and columns ... what does that mean? Let us see with an example. To work out the ans …
