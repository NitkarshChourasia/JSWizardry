####  Not Quite Perfect  ####

A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of all its proper (non-self) divisors. Take 6 for example:
___
6 = 1 + 2 + 3
_____

A number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors -- provided that one of them is negative -- is not quite perfect, but admirable.
To illustrate. The proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, totalling 16. However, if 2 is negative, the total would be 12, the number itself. 12 is therefore an admirable number.
___
12 = 1 - 2 + 3 + 4 + 6
_____

Create a function that takes a number n as input.
