####  Hole Number Sequence  ####

What do the digits 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have in common? Well, they are whole numbers... and they are also hole numbers (not actually a thing until now). Hole numbers are numbers with holes in their shapes (8 is special in that it contains two holes).
14 is a hole number with one hole. 88 is a hole number with four holes.
Your task is to create a function with argument N that returns the sum of the holes for the integers n in the range of range 0 < n <= N.
To illustrate, sumOfHoles(14) returns 7, because there are 7 holes in 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 14.


[Examples]

___
sumOfHoles(4) ➞ 1

sumOfHoles(6) ➞ 2

sumOfHoles(8) ➞ 4

sumOfHoles(6259) ➞ 12345
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All test cases are positive real integers.
*) Don't forget that 8 has two holes.
