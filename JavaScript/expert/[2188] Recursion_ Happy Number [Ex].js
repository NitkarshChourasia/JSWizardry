####  Recursion: Happy Number  ####

A happy number is a number which yields a 1 by repeatedly summing up the square of its digits. If such a process results in an endless cycle of numbers containing 4, the number is said to be an unhappy number.
Create a function that accepts a number and determines whether the number is a happy number or not. Return true if so, false otherwise.


[Examples]

___
isHappy(67) ➞ false

isHappy(89) ➞ false

isHappy(139) ➞ true

isHappy(1327) ➞ false

isHappy(2871) ➞ false

isHappy(3970) ➞ true
