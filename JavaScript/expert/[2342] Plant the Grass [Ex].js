####  Plant the Grass  ####

You will be given a matrix representing a field g and two numbers x, y coordinate.
There are three types of possible characters in the matrix:
___
*) x representing a rock.
*) o representing a dirt space.
*) + representing a grassed space.
___

You have to simulate grass growing from the position (x, y). Grass can grow in all four directions (up, left, right, down). Grass can only grow on dirt spaces and can't go past rocks.
Return the simulated matrix.


[Examples]

___
simulateGrass([
  "xxxxxxx",
  "xooooox",
  "xxxxoox"
  "xoooxxx"
  "xxxxxxx"
], 1, 1) âžž [
