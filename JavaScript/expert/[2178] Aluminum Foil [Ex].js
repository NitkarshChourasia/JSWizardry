####  Aluminum Foil  ####

Aluminum foil has a thickness of 0.025mm. A roll is formed by tightly winding it around a tube with an outside diameter of 4cm. Given the length of the foil in cm, write a function that returns the diameter of the roll in cm measured at its thickest point. Round the result to four places.


[Examples]

___
foil(0) ➞ 4.0

foil(50) ➞ 4.02

foil(4321) ➞ 5.4575

foil(10000) ➞ 6.9175

We can get the thickness d of any roll of paper in terms of R, r, and L, where L is the total length of the roll if it were unrolled. (Obviously L = n×l.)
