####  True or False Array?  ####

I admit, this challenge is somehow strange. The objective is to find out if a given array is true or false. Here are some true arrays:
___
[12, 40, 4, 6420, 20, 24, 400, 24]
[12.3, 46, 4, 7383, 23, 27, 529, 27.6]
[14, 80, 6, 12840, 40, 46, 1600, 48]
_____

And here some false arrays:
___
[18.1, 162, 9, 26091, 81, 90, 6561, 97]
[14.5, 90, 18, 14445, 18, 51, 2025, 54]
[19.2, 184, 9, 29592, 92, 101, 8464, 110.8]
_____

All 8 values in the arrays are connected in some way, you have to find out what the connection is. Go and play around with the 150 test cases and you'll figure it out.


[Examples]

___
tfArr([12, 40, 4, 6420, 20, 24, 400, 24]) ➞ true

tfArr([18.1, 162, 9, 26091, 81, 90, 6561, 97]) ➞ false

tfArr([14.7, 94, 6, 15087, 47, 53, 2209, 56.4]) ➞ true
_____
