####  Syllables of a Word  ####

In this challenge, you are tasked to return the syllables of a word in an array. To find a syllables, if one consonant follows a vowel, divide the word between the vowel and the consonant. if two consonants follow a vowel, divide the word between the two consonants. However, when the last letter is "e", if the letter before it is a consonant, it would become a silent letter and would therefore be added to the syllable before instead of being its own syllable.


[Examples]

___
syllable("happy") ➞ ["hap" ,  py"]

syllable("motel") ➞ ["mo" , "tel"]

syllable("pancake") ➞ ["pan" , "cake"]

syllable("dogumaru") ➞ ["do" , "gu" , "ma" , "ru"]

syllable("abbufhafa") ➞ ["ab" , "buf" , "ha" , "fa"]
