####  Jumbled Words  ####

For this challenge, you are given a string of letters in alphabetical order and an index. If a list of all the permutations of those letters are put in lexicographical order, a legitimate word is located at the given index. You are to identify that word.
For example:
___
jumble("isn", 4) ➞ sin"
_____

The permutations are:
___
["ins", "isn", "nis", "nsi", "sin", "sni"]
_____

The permutation at index 4 is "sin".


[Examples]

___
jumble("em", 1) ➞ "me"

jumble("aiv", 5) ➞ "via"

jumble("abdeit", 408) ➞ "edabit"

jumble("abdeit", 137) ➞ "baited"

jumble("abefgilnoruv", 425933017) ➞ "unforgivable"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The test case words are heterographs (i.e. all the letters are different).
*) It is too time-consuming to generate every permutation for some of the longer words (check the Resources tab for another way).

If all of the permutations of a string are listed alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. What is the nth lexicographical permutation of a given string?
