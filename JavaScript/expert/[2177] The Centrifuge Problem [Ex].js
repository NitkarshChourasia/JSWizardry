####  The Centrifuge Problem  ####

A centrifuge, as you probably know, is a laboratory device used to separate fluids based on density. The separation is achieved through centripetal force by spinning a collection of test tubes at high speeds. This means, the configuration needs to be in balance.
Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments n and k and returns true if the configuration is balanced and false if it's not. To check out the formula, look at the resources tab.

Here are the valid configurations for n = 6, k = 2, 3, 4 and 6.


[Examples]

___
cFuge(6, 4) ➞ true

cFuge(2, 1) ➞ false

cFuge(3, 3) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

___
*) One test tube k = 1 is never in balance.
*) One hole n = 1 is never in balance, even empty.
___

On Vanishing Sums of Distinct Roots of Unity
http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EMIS/journals/INTEGERS/papers/k31/k31.pdf
We show that for any integers n ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, one may find k distinct nth roots of unity whose sum is 0 if and only if both k and n − k are expressible as linear c …
