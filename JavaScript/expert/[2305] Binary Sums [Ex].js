####  Binary Sums  ####

Adding fractional binary numbers is similar to adding decimals. The places to the right of the decimal point (or binary point) are halves, quarters, eighths instead of tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.
Improvise a function that takes two fractional binary numbers and produces their base-10 sum. The sum can be a whole number, a fraction, or a mixed number. The answer should be returned as a string with fractions reduced to lowest terms.


[Examples]

___
binarySum(["1.1", "1.1"]) ➞ "3"
// 1.5 + 1.5

binarySum(["11.1", "0.001"]) ➞ "3 5/8"
// 3.5 + 0.125

binarySum(["1101.0", "0.0100"]) ➞ "13 1/4"
// 13 + 1/4

binarySum(["0.11", "0.00001"]) ➞ "25/32"
// 3/4 + 1/32

binarySum(["0.0", "101.00"]) ➞ "5"
