####  Newton-Raphson method  ####

Create a function that finds a root of a polynomial curve. Do this using the Newton-Raphson method.
___
*) Your input will be an array of coefficients for a 3rd order polynomial: c(0)*x^3 + c(1)*x^2 + c(2)*x + c(3)
*) Round your answer to three decimal places (nearest 0.001). Choose x = 0.0 as an initial guess. Twenty iterations of the algorithm are sufficient for accuracy.
*) The Newton-Raphson method uses the generic derivative df/dx. This can be calculated analytically for a polynomial, or numerically using a small step of dx (such as 0.0001). See the Resources tab for more info.
