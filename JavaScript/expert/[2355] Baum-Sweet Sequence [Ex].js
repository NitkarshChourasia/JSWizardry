####  Baum-Sweet Sequence  ####

Create a function that takes a number n and returns all the terms of the Baum-Sweet sequence, from 0 to n (included).
The Baum-Sweet sequence is the sequence of numbers bi such that bi = 1 if the binary representation of i contains no block of consecutive 0 of odd length, and bi = 0 otherwise.


[Examples]

___
baumSweet(0) ➞ "0"

baumSweet(1) ➞ "01"

baumSweet(10) ➞ "01011001010"
_____



[Notes]

For all cases, n >= 0.

For example, b4 = 1 because the binary representation of 4 is 100, which only contains one block of consecutive 0s of length 2; whereas b5 = 0 because the binary repres …
