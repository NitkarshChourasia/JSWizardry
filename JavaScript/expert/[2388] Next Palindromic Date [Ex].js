####  Next Palindromic Date  ####

The 2nd of February 2020 is a palindromic date in both dd/mm/yyyy and mm/dd/yyyy format (02/02/2020).
February 2, 2020 is the only 2-digit month and day palindromic date that will occur in the 21st century. The next occurrence of a 2-digit month and day palindromic date will be December 12, 2121, which is exactly 101 years from the last occurrence. 101 is also a palindrome. Between the years, 3030 and 9090, exactly 1010 years separate each occurrence of a 2-digit month and day palindromic date.
Given a date in mm/dd/yyyy format and the number of years to scan, return an array containing palindromic dates in mm/dd/yyyy format that are palindromic in both dd/mm/yyyy and mm/dd/yyyy format.
